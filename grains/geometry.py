class Mesh(ABC):
    """Data structure for a general mesh.

    This class by no means wants to provide intricate functionalities and does not strive to be
    efficient at all. Its purpose is to give some useful features the project relies on.
    The two main entities in the mesh are the `vertices` and the `cells`. They are expected to be
    passed by the user, so reading from various mesh files is not implemented. This keeps the
    class simple, requires few package dependencies and keeps the class focused as there are
    powerful tools to convert among mesh formats (see e.g. `meshio
    <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`_).

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : ndarray
        2D numpy array with 2 columns, each row corresponding to a vertex, and the two columns
        giving the Cartesian coordinates of the vertex.
    cells : ndarray
        Cell-vertex connectivities in a 2D numpy array, in which each row corresponds to a
        cell and the columns are the vertices of the cells. It is assumed that all the cells
        have the same number of vertices.

    --------
    ~TriMesh.change_vertex_numbering

    Notes
    -----
    Although not necessary, it is highly recommended that the local vertex numbering in the
    cells are the same, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Some methods, such as
    :meth:`get_boundary` even requires it. If you are not sure whether the cells you provide
    have a consistent numbering, it is better to renumber them by calling the
    :meth:`~TriMesh.change_vertex_numbering` method.

        Notes
        -----
        We traverse through the cells of the mesh, and within each cell the edges. The edges are
        stored as new entries in a dictionary if they are not already stored. Checking if a key
        exists in a dictionary is performed in O(1). The number of edges in a cell is independent
        of the mesh density. Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is
        the number of cells in the mesh.

            boundary edge. The dictionary is ordered: the consecutive keys represent the
            consecutive boundary edges. Although a boundary edge is part of a single cell, that
            cell is given in a list so as to maintain the same format as the one used in the
            :meth:`get_edges` method.

        Notes
        -----
        The reason why consistent cell vertex numbering is demanded is because in that case the
        boundary edges are oriented in such a way that the second vertex of a boundary edge is
        the first vertex of the boundary edge it connects to.

        cell_legends, vertex_legends : bool, optional
            If True, cell/vertex set legends are shown. The default is False. For many sets,

            very slow.

        Returns
        -------
        None

        Notes
        -----
        If you do not want to plot the cells, only the vertices, pass the :code:`'.'` option, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: python

            mesh.plot('k.')

        to plot the vertices in black. Here, :code:`mesh` is a `TriMesh` object.

        Examples
        --------
        A sample mesh is constructed by creating uniformly randomly distributed points on the
        rectangular domain [-1, 1] x [1, 2]. These points will constitute the vertices of the
        mesh, while its cells are the Delaunay triangles on the vertices.

        >>> msh = TriMesh(*TriMesh.sample_mesh(1))

        The cells are drawn in greeen, in 3 points of line width, and the vertices of the mesh
        are shown in blue.

        >>> msh.plot('go-', linewidth=3, markerfacecolor='b', vertex_labels=True)
        >>> plt.show()

        Notes
        -----
        The plotting is done by calling :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.triplot`, which internally
        makes a deep copy of the triangles. This increases the memory usage in case of many
        elements.

        The aim of this method is to support basic post-processing for finite element visualization.

        ----------
        component : int
            Positive integer, the selected component of the field to be plotted. Components are
